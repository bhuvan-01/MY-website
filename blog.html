        <h1>Metaverse: A virtual universe with very real opportunities</h1>
        <p>It’s a Sunday afternoon and after an early lunch, Mike, a Gen Z video game lover, was “deeply immersed” within a VR kit, making his digital avatar win his favorite video game on Nintendo Switch. While he plays the survival game, many “in-game” billboards with ads for pizza, warm beverages, and “take a break” catch his attention. As digestive enzymes trigger his hunger, Mike goads his father into buying pizzas, who does so, not physically but by scanning through one of the “in-game” billboards with his smartphone while the payment is done from the bitcoin balance Mike had earned by playing the game. With orders placed, a happy Mike continues playing while the pizza is on his way home. Having gorged on his pizza after some time, Mike, an efficient guitar player with an active account on SoundCloud virtual, gets down to compose something new, and once done, he simply uploads the recorded piece onto Soundcloud Virtual as an NFT. Mike and his friends keep trading their NFTs between them, like a mutual appreciation club transferring bitcoins with glee and feeling appreciated for their compositions, the very bitcoins that they earn playing video games.

            That was a Sunday well spent on the “Metaverse”..</p>

        <h1>Metaverse- The next big promise in the digital world</h1>
        <p>The Metaverse, the digital world’s Next Big Promise, is being seen as a parallel “3D virtual world” where each human being gets to own an avatar as an identity. These animated avatars would be capable of virtually doing all sorts of real-world activities in virtual worlds, from shopping to gaming to traveling to owning and selling real estate. For now, some tech-savvy couples have hosted their marriage and reception parties in the Metaverse. How cool is that!

            Gartner defines a Metaverse as a collective virtual shared space created by the convergence of virtually enhanced physical and digital reality. It is persistent, providing enhanced immersive experiences, as well as device-independent, and accessible through any type of device, from tablets to head-mounted displays. It also predicts that by 2026, 25% of people will spend at least one hour per day on the Metaverse.
            
            While majority around the globe are still coming to terms with Metaverse and all that it encapsulates, early investments by pioneers like Meta (the company), Fortnite (the game), Somnium Space (a VR world builder), IMVU (an avatar-based 3D social network) and many others have swollen the Metaverse market size to about $47bn (with around $10bn out of this committed by Meta itself) with predicted market size of around $800bn by 2024. We are talking of a 16 times growth rate within the next 2-3 years, which is mind-numbingly mammoth.
            
            Building blocks of metaverse- What comprises this evolving magical world?
            
            Mike’s Sunday afternoon with which we started this piece encapsulates all the key building blocks of metaverse:

                <h1>Metaverse brings together the experience economy</h1>
                <p>The biggest property of Metaverse is bringing together various dimensions of “Experience Economy”. Experience is a function of the right infrastructure with intelligent interfaces that supports decentralized existence of data closer to devices while enabling consumption of immersive experiences, thus encouraging the creator community to compose and publish innovative pieces of work in the form of NFTs, which when discovered through multifaceted marketing results in esoteric experiences which is unprecedented. Such experiences, in turn, produce massive units of data that get fed back into the loop to create a continuum of the experience economy. The below illustration explains this loop.</p>               <div class="metaverse">
